# NutClient Development Plan

## Context

Custom .NET 8 NUT client for graceful server shutdown on UPS power loss. Designed as a cross-platform replacement for the broken NUT-for-Windows build and the retired WinNUT-Client. Runs as a Windows service or Linux systemd service.

## Architecture

```
  NUT Server                         NutClient (each server)
 ┌──────────────┐                   ┌──────────────────────────┐
 │ upsd :3493   │◄── TCP poll ──────│ NutClient                │
 │              │    every 5s       │                          │
 └──────────────┘                   │ On battery → 60s timer   │
                                    │ Timer expires → script   │
                                    │ Low battery → immediate  │
                                    │ FSD → immediate          │
                                    │ Dead time → shutdown     │
                                    │ Power restored → cancel  │
                                    └──────────────────────────┘

## Phase 1: Development — DONE

- [x] Cross-platform .NET 8 app (Windows + Linux)
- [x] Polls ups.status, battery.charge, battery.runtime, input.voltage, ups.load
- [x] Shutdown triggers: OB timer, LB, FSD, battery charge/runtime thresholds
- [x] Disable timer with `ShutdownDelaySeconds: 0` for threshold-only shutdown
- [x] Dead time safety — shuts down if server unreachable while on battery
- [x] Pre-shutdown hook — optional command before main shutdown
- [x] Shutdown reason + UPS data passed as script arguments
- [x] Error handling — typed errors, exponential backoff
- [x] Startup messaging — "Cannot reach NUT server yet" and "Successfully connected for the first time"
- [x] Status file (nutclient-status.json) with 25-entry rolling history
- [x] Log rotation with configurable size
- [x] LogLevel config: "events" (default, quiet) vs "all" (every poll)
- [x] Example shutdown scripts (PowerShell + bash) with param blocks
- [x] State machine extracted for testability
- [x] **89 unit/integration tests** with mock NUT server
- [x] Full README with setup, config, developer docs
- [x] Install scripts for Linux and Windows (preserve existing config on upgrade)
- [x] Linux install: clear distro compatibility notes (Debian-tested, systemd check)
- [x] Windows service: retries forever (10s, 30s, 5min, then every 5min)
- [x] Linux systemd: `Restart=always` with 10s delay + 7 conservative hardening directives
- [x] GitHub Actions CI — auto-build + release on tag push (win-x64, linux-x64, linux-arm64)
- [x] CI workflow runs tests on every push and PR
- [x] Sanitized config templates and docs (no personal info)
- [x] MIT License
- [x] Persistent NUT connection — `LOGIN <ups>` registers client with server, visible in `LIST CLIENT`
- [x] Clean error messages on missing/malformed config (no stack traces)
- [x] **v1.5.0 released** (current). Release history:
  - v1.0.0 — initial
  - v1.1.0 — `ShutdownDelaySeconds: 0` to disable timer
  - v1.2.0 — sanitized configs
  - v1.3.0 — startup messaging, CI workflow, Windows retry-forever, install fixes
  - v1.4.0 — security hardening (F1 sanitize, F2 perms, F3 bounded reader, F4 systemd, F5/F6/F8/F12)
  - v1.4.1 — clean error messages for bad config
  - v1.5.0 — **persistent NUT connection with LOGIN registration**

---

## Phase 2: Testing with Dedicated Test UPS — DONE

Test setup: Raspberry Pi running NUT with APC Back-UPS ES 850G2 plus a `dummy-ups` driver for simulating arbitrary status values.

- [x] **2.1** Set up test NUT server (Raspberry Pi + APC Back-UPS)
- [x] **2.2** Verify polling in console mode
- [x] **2.3** Install as systemd service on Linux, verify auto-start on reboot
- [x] **2.4** Install as Windows service on jldev, verify auto-start on reboot
- [x] **2.5** Simulate power loss — verified 60s countdown and shutdown with correct args
- [x] **2.6** Test power flicker — verified shutdown cancels on restore
- [x] **2.6.1** Set up `dummy-ups` driver on test NUT server for safe simulation of LB/FSD/dead time
- [x] **2.7** Test LB/FSD — verified immediate shutdown for both `OB LB` and `FSD` (no 60s wait)
- [x] **2.8** Test dead time — verified shutdown 30s after server unreachable while on battery. Confirmed regular timer pauses when polls fail (timer check only runs in HandleStatus on successful poll), making dead time the essential safety net for network outages during power failures.

---

## Phase 3: Production Rollout — DONE (initial)

- [x] **3.0** v1.3.0 released with Phase 2 fixes (startup messaging, Windows retry-forever, install instructions, CI workflow)
- [x] **3.0.1** Upgrade test verified — upgrading from v1.2.0 → v1.3.0 preserves nutclient.json and customized shutdown scripts, restarts the service cleanly
- [x] **3.1** Initial production rollout — deployed to one Windows and one Linux server. More servers can be added incrementally as needed.
- [ ] **3.2** End-to-end test with a real UPS unplug on a production server (deferred — can be done opportunistically during the next planned outage)

---

## Phase 4: Hardening — IN PROGRESS

- [x] **4.1** Test edge cases — **DONE.** Verified 6 scenarios against the live test environment (nutpi + dummyups):
  - **Rapid flicker:** 3 cycles of OL↔OB within ~30s. State machine handles each transition cleanly, never triggers shutdown.
  - **NUT server restart:** Stop nut-server while client is connected, wait 20s, restart. Client logs poll errors with backoff (5s/10s/20s), then "Connection restored after N failed poll(s)".
  - **Server back JUST before dead time:** Server unreachable for ~30s while client is on battery, comes back. Client correctly resumes without false shutdown.
  - **SIGTERM mid-countdown:** Sent SIGTERM at "On battery for 5s". Process exited cleanly in 28ms. Shutdown script never called (correct cancellation).
  - **Malformed nutclient.json:** Found a UX issue — exception bubbled up as a 50-line stack trace. **FIXED in Program.cs:** wrapped JSON parsing in try/catch, prints clean error and exits with code 1.
  - **Missing nutclient.json:** Same UX issue, same fix.
  - **Unwritable log file:** F8 fix works perfectly — `Log file write failed` warning fires once (throttled), service keeps running with events going to stdout/journalctl.
- [ ] **4.2** Configure Hyper-V VM auto-start on each host (if applicable) — operational task, not a NutClient code change. Defer to ops.

## Phase 5: Security Hardening — DONE

Findings from a focused security audit. Threat model: NutClient runs as root/SYSTEM, connects outbound to a NUT server on a trusted LAN over plain TCP. **No critical RCE found.** All HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW items addressed.

**Progress:** 7 of 7 done. All HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW items fixed. INFO items either won't fix or documented as known assumptions.

### HIGH

- [x] **5.1 (F1)** Argument injection from NUT `ups.status` into shutdown command line — **FIXED.** Added `SanitizeUpsStatus()` that whitelists status tokens to known NUT flags only (OL, OB, LB, FSD, CHRG, etc.) and drops everything else. A malicious server returning `"OB LB EVIL_INJECTION rm"` now reaches the shutdown script as `"OB LB"`. Verified end-to-end against the dummy UPS server with a logging shutdown script. 15 unit tests cover the sanitization including quote-breakout, shell metacharacters, backticks, newlines, and case-sensitivity.

### MEDIUM

- [x] **5.2 (F2)** `nutclient.json` file permissions not enforced after install — **FIXED.** `install.sh` now runs `chown root:root && chmod 600` on the config file (applied unconditionally so upgrades from older installs also fix the perms). `install.ps1` runs `icacls /inheritance:r /grant SYSTEM:F /grant Administrators:F` to strip inherited Users:Read and grant only SYSTEM and Administrators. Also added a runtime check in NutMonitorService startup that warns in the log if the config file is group/other-readable on Linux — defense in depth for users who installed manually or with an older script. Verified end-to-end: warning fires with 644, silent with 600.
- [x] **5.3 (F3)** Unbounded `ReadLineAsync` in `NutConnection.ReadResponseAsync` — **FIXED.** Replaced `StreamReader.ReadLineAsync` with a manual byte-by-byte reader bounded at 8 KB. Throws `NutException(Transient)` if a response line exceeds the limit. Handles both LF and CRLF line endings. Removed the now-unused `_reader` field. 4 new tests: oversized line throws Transient with "exceeded" message, line at exactly the 8191-byte limit succeeds, both CRLF and LF endings work. End-to-end smoke tested against real NUT server — normal polling unchanged. 80 → 84 tests.
- [x] **5.4 (F4)** systemd unit has no hardening directives — **PARTIALLY FIXED (conservative).** Added 7 hardening directives that block exotic attacks but don't restrict shutdown scripts: `NoNewPrivileges`, `ProtectKernelTunables`, `ProtectKernelModules`, `ProtectControlGroups`, `LockPersonality`, `RestrictRealtime`, `RestrictSUIDSGID`. The more aggressive directives (`ProtectSystem=strict`, `ProtectHome`, `RestrictAddressFamilies`, `CapabilityBoundingSet`, `SystemCallFilter`, `MemoryDenyWriteExecute`) are included as commented-out opt-in because they would break shutdown scripts that need to write outside `/var/log` and `/opt/nutclient`, use raw sockets, mount filesystems, etc. Documented the tradeoff and opt-in instructions in a new "Hardening (Linux)" section in the README. Validated unit syntax with `systemd-analyze verify`.

### LOW

- [x] **5.5 (F5/F6)** Status file and log file got default umask permissions — **FIXED.** Added `SetSecurePermissions()` helper that sets 0640 (owner rw, group r, other none) on Linux. Applied to: status file (after writing the .tmp), log file (on first creation), and rotated log backup. No-op on Windows. Verified: log and status files are now created at 0640 instead of 0644.
- [x] **5.6 (F8)** `Log` and `RotateLogIfNeeded` swallow all exceptions silently — **FIXED.** Replaced `catch { }` with `catch (Exception ex) { _logger.LogWarning(...) }` so failures surface in journalctl/Event Log. Added `_logWriteFailureReported` flag so a persistent failure (full disk, bad perms) is reported once per failure streak instead of every poll. Same treatment for `RotateLogIfNeeded`.
- [x] **5.7 (F12)** `Thread.Sleep` during pre-shutdown delay ignored cancellation — **FIXED.** Replaced with `await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(...), ct)`. Plumbed `CancellationToken` through `ProcessPollDecisionAsync`, `ProcessStatusDecisionAsync`, and `ExecuteShutdownAsync` (renamed from sync versions). If the delay is cancelled (e.g., systemctl stop), proceed directly to the main shutdown command — that's intentional, the pre-shutdown hook already ran.

### INFO (won't fix unless needed)

- **F7** install.sh doesn't verify what it's copying — informational, mitigated by users running it next to the release artifact
- **F9** NUT response text echoed verbatim into exception messages — does not leak the password, just attacker-chosen text into client log
- **F10** No TLS to NUT — explicitly assumed in threat model (trusted LAN), document in SECURITY.md and README
- **F11** Example shutdown scripts don't validate args — defense in depth, low value since they don't re-feed args to other commands

### What's already done well (per audit)

- `UpsStateMachine` is pure and well-structured, easy to test
- `BatteryCharge`/`BatteryRuntime` parsed through `int.TryParse` before reaching `ExecuteShutdown` — neutralizes numeric-field injection
- Status file write is atomic (.tmp + rename)
- `UseShellExecute = false` — no shell interpretation
- Config never reloaded hot — local config attackers don't get live re-execution
- `AccessDenied` is terminal — stops cleanly instead of hammering server
- 5-second per-read timeout on socket
- `NutConnection` IDisposable cleanup is thorough

---

## Safety Points

- 60s battery countdown prevents shutdown on brief flickers
- Dead time (30s default) shuts down if NUT server unreachable while on battery
- Threshold-based shutdown only triggers when already on battery
- Pre-shutdown hook runs before main shutdown for alerts/cleanup
- LB and FSD from the UPS always trigger immediate shutdown as safety nets
- Startup grace: client never shuts down on a "can't reach server" error if it has never successfully connected
